# KNN Classifier with Ranking Algorithm

This repository contains a Python implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and a ranking algorithm. The KNN classifier is used to predict the class of a new data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors in the training data. The ranking algorithm is used to rank a list of items based on their scores.

## KNN Classifier

The `KNNClassifier` class is a simple implementation of a KNN classifier. The constructor takes the number of neighbors to use as an argument. The `fit` method fits the classifier to the training data, and the `predict` method predicts the class of a new data point.

## Ranking Algorithm

The `RankingAlgorithm` class is a simple implementation of a ranking algorithm. The `rank_items` method takes a list of items and their scores as arguments, and returns a list of the items ranked in descending order of their scores.

## Usage

To use the KNN classifier and ranking algorithm, first import the `KNNClassifier` and `RankingAlgorithm` classes from the `algorithm.py` file. Then, create a `KNNClassifier` object and fit it to the training data. Next, create a `RankingAlgorithm` object and use it to rank a list of items based on their scores.

The following code snippet shows how to use the KNN classifier and ranking algorithm:

```python
from algorithm import KNNClassifier, RankingAlgorithm

# Create a KNN classifier object
knn = KNNClassifier(k=3)

# Fit the classifier to the training data
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create a RankingAlgorithm object
ranking_algo = RankingAlgorithm()

# Rank the items based on their scores
ranked_items = ranking_algo.rank_items(items, sales_scores)

# Print the KNN predictions and ranked items
print("KNN Predictions:", knn.predict([[2017, 900000], [2022, 1400000]]))
print("Ranked Items:", ranked_items)
```

## Output

The output of the code snippet above is as follows:

```
KNN Predictions: ['F34', 'S23']
Ranked Items: ['S23', 'F34', 'M34', 'A34']
```
